            i just want to make a statement about Akari and my friend Mimi drama about ocxventi...i have many coments about akari first of all why are you letting your friends attack mimi you should be accountanable on your problem with mimi YOU should be the one delaring the things with mimi NOT your minions. Second why are you making a big deal about everything she does? its literally bullying i get it you're 15-16 you cant comprehend this things easily but come on you have to learn some how and it should not be continued for you and your future in the end its full of regrets and guilt. Third mimi already apologized many times to you and what do you do? IGNORE HER like her apology didnt even exist yet your rage continue on? i dont get it do you just want to hate her for having her oc shipped with venti?, mimi is a good friend she has empanthy she doesnt like having friends leave her You were her friend and shes one to apologize to you. She doesnt deserve any hatred you're one entitled. Forth Acussing mimi SO MUCH of copying and venti g her oc? what the fuck is wrong with you that got me pissed of so much if it wasnt for mimi kindness i would have already said so much more, what do you tell your friends about mimi? do you HAVE to make up a whole other story just to get your friends to hate her? and your also a hypocrite your friends are very blind for your own videos having venti lose control(drunk) and started with your akari oc?? holy mischaratazation and its fucking gross... "arent you an ocxventi creator to?" yes i am and i still do cause i like my own ship dynamic for a good reasons BUT i dont put any hate on OTHER OCXVENTI unless they are proven to be problematic like i said SOOO many times i genuinely support ventixoc creators one for liking venti two for making contents about their ocs and their ship. i'll understand if you are a nonsharing yume shipper theres a boundary and im not one to bother it INSTEAD OF hating. ts is always venti let him breath come on he's not gonna come up in the screen and kiss you or something i would think that would be very weird the amount of delusional is insane to hate another and also people can move on and heal YOU DONT HAVE TO MAKE SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT THEIR PAST MISTAKES i would be so much more happy if you mind your own businesses and enjoy your own thing this goes for anyone one else instead of being dreadful learn how to come clean to your mistakes, calling your mistakes is NOT BAD its for you to became a better person

Scenerio / Summary : Senior High Confession, At School Feild trip Venti invites Arthia to sneak away from the camp and follow him to a quiet hill he knows. He tells her it’s just for a “private band practice,” but deep down, Hes hiding the fact that hes about to confess his feelings, Venti sets up a small camp with a blanket, and his guitar. The mood is peaceful and calm,When arthia asked about the song Venti says it’s new and “unfinished,” pretending to keep it casual. As he begins to sing, the lyrics slowly reveal his true feelings
<p align="Right">
Venti : "Arthia... i like you
I’ve liked you since we were kids.
I like how you’d sneak out just to see me even when your father warned you not to.
I like how fearless you are, You stood up like you had nothing to lose. I like you, Arthia.
Not just tonight. Not just because it’s peaceful.
But in every single moment we shared, This feeling’s have been haunting me since the day you showed up in my life.”
<p align="left">
Arthia : "I have been waiting for you to say something..You broke my perfection , You taught me how to live with failure, how to laugh at it, how to grow from it.
You healed all the broken little pieces I tried to hide. You made me beautiful Venti.."
<p align="right">
Venti : "you have always been beautiful, you just need someone to see it."
