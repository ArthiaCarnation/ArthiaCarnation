            — Arthia and Venti switch flowers on their rings to symbolize their love for one another. Arthia wears Venti’s Cecilia, and Venti wears Arthia’s Carnation. It symbolizes that their love is not just about themselves but about honoring and protecting one another. A sign of unity, devotion, and carrying a piece of each other’s soul.

In her restless solitude… every storm, every fought, she weeps on her own throne. A goddess crowned in sorrow, yet pretending the weights upon her shoulders did not crush her bones.
Yet even in her silence, she longs for someone who sees her beyond the title she carries.
I became her sanctuary her light, her warmth , her peace.
                                       <p align="center">
"Such a heavy heart, my goddess… Why carry it alone? You hold storms meant for a thousand worlds. Let me be the gentle one, The song that steadies your heart as the world waits for you to breathe again."
                                                   <p align="center">
Only I can soothe her with a song crafted from my heart, sung meant for only her alone..
She is the world’s strength…for I am the one who holds her when she finally lets herself be fragile.

                      I felt the world fall apart until only he remained.
His breath brushed my skin like a prayer warm, steady, unhurried, as if touching me was the most sacred.
                      <p align="center">
Every part of me softened.
Every doubt, every burden, every storm inside me melted.
                            <p align="center">
There was no duty, no divinity… only the warmth of his hands and the gentle truth of being seen. In that fragile warmth I let myself fall into him completely.

         Book 1 Our Promise : The Bard and His Goddess 
              <p align="center">
    Freedom was supposed to mean following your own heart... but right now his heart was pointing straight toward her.

    “Venti…” she repeated tasting the name like it carried weight Her eyes softened “You seem… different I can feel something within you only gods carry that kind of power”
<p align="left">
Venti’s grin grew quiet but sincere She’d seen right through him
“Oh? you’ve got quite the eye” he said lowering his voice “What gave me away?”
<p align="right">
“Your voice” Arthia replied “The way you sang for the children this morning it carried warmth, not just melody You gave them peace.” Her tone softened almost like she was confessing admiration. Then turning her gaze away again she asked “What are you doing here truly?” Her words hit him deeper than he expected He wasn’t used to being seen like that not for what he gave but for what he meant. He chuckled softly leaning back with a sigh
<p align="left">
“I could say I was following destiny" His eyes glimmered as he added softly “…and it led me right to you.”
